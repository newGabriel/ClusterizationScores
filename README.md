#Clusterization Scores

this project includes three of the main measures for evaluating clusterings based on ground truth, purity, collocation, and the harmonic mean between purity and collocation.

the project is based on the clustering result of the sklearn library available for python3 and its only requirement is the numpy library which can be obtained from [link](https://numpy.org/install/) or:

`` pip install numpy ``
